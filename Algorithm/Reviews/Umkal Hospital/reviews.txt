Enter at your own risk. They do not have the expertise to treat many ailments, yet they try to hold on patients through posturing. They will give wrong advice in order to make money. Their over arching intention is to ensnare patients and milk them for money.The doctors here are General Practitioners, not specialists. They do not provide referrals to specialists when required as they want to keep the patient at Umkal to make money, even if the patient requires specialized treatment. In terms of facilities, it is a very basic hospital. They do not have much equipment. They are not able to keep up with the well equipped newer hospitals in Gurgaon. They are more of a slaughterhouse than a hospital. They do not care about the outcome or results. They just want to make money.
Umkal hospital just want to make money only money they not blive in humanity they're all just believe how to make money form a normal peasant.....
Same on you
Umcal Hospital in Gurgaon  is a medium size  Hospital where AAM ADMI ( nothing to do with AAP political party) can get affordable quality care with compassionate personal touch. My experience has been very good. With so many big name hospitals in Gurgaon, UMCAL has a nitch for common person like me.
