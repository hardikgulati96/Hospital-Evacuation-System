For ages Dr Navin Kumar has been serving the residents of this small town of Uttar Pradesh selflessly. The queues never seem to end outside his chamber but still the doctor sees every patient rich or poor with the same kind of devotion. Such doctors are rare these days. The hospital offers complete range of services in terms of consultation, diagnostics, hospitalization, surgeries, emergencies and intensive care. While most of the doctors these days prefer the metro cities, this highly qualified doctor from King George Medical College, Lucknow chose this small town to give his services. I hail this selfless spirit.
