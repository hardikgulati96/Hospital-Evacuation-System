The facilities being provided by the Govt are very high class. But the bureaucracy here is too lazy and corrupt to implement the policies adequately and on time. Medicines aren't available on time. Equipment and lab services aren't being maintained properly
 
Good & cooperative staff ...good service by central government
Facilily is not satisfactory
Good hospital and the staff is also well but some time hospital's,area not clean others wise doctor and staf are good and supportive
I was in emergency and they asked for the ESI card. I don't know, what is the  priority emergency treatment or ESI card?
