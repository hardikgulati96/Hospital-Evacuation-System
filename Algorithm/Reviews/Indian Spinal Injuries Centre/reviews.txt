Both knees of my wife were replaced at ISIC last June. She was in the private ward for about 10 days and we found the treatment very good and care, par excellence. Dr N Bhushan is simply the best and one should not think twice and consult him. As it look, the entire staff has given special orientation. Thanks Dr Bhushan. Though a bit expensive but after discharge advise/physio was quite satisfactory.

Very poor and rude behaviour on telephonic appointment booking. I was having very much pain and when i called for emergengy they told you will have to wait dont come same day and slightly cut the line. This shows how uneducated customer care staff serving there.
Very Bad experience.I was hit by Dr.Jaskirat Kaur as a revenge from Dr.Kshitja Bansal when we ended it up in an argument.Very unprofessional faculty n therapists.And negligence on the part of patients is very common.Ladies keep on knitting sweaters there
Booked appt for my dad with neurophyscian to get second opinion. And surely, the process were less complicated and doctor is okey. Doctor advised us for MRI scan and even on written protocol mention
