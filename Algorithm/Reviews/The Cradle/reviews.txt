Best hospital for gynaecological surgeries in Gurgaon. Drs. Chetna Jain, Dr. (Lt. General) Punita Arora, Dr. Renu Misra are among the best surgeons around.
One of the best hospital in Gurgaon with good child specialists and gynecologists. Their NICU is costly but they have strong team of pediatricians.
Doctors are very good and the price in reasonable. Doctors and staffs are very co-operative. Im happy with my experience. Highly recommended
We went for our scan..its our first so naturally we would have questions but the staff was not at all interested.. she simply took the scan..when i asked i want to see..she said let me do the measurements and calculations...and there after soon ended the scan...i am not happy with their way.. appointment has no meaning cause 5.30 actually means 6.30 according to their timings..u always have to wait...is there any better facility...
Best mother & child care hospital in gurgaon
