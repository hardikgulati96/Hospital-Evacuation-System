nicely attended by doctors but washrooms was so dirty n stinky there was no soap or liquid hand-wash in washroom for patients n the bedsheet of our bed was stained with blood. There was lot of boards of swach bharat abhiyan but there was no swachta in hospital.
Good faculty....I Am happy
Good doctors and nurse are in orthopedic 
Very bad experience... Doctors are not knowing the proper address of lab and due to that patients are wandering...
Very Bad Service...
Bad Experience...
My mother had a problem of "Pitt ki Pathri".
We had taken her to Ambedkar Hospital, as this is the big hospital at Rohini.
She was very curious and excited that doctors would cure and save her.
But doctors didn't talk to her politely.
They have given 4 bottles of glucose in a single night (instead of giving the medicines of Pitt ki Pathri), yet, I think 2 was suffice.
But they had not given any medicines. We have taken our mother at home at 2pm.
She had been suffering from stomach pain for the whole night.
Even they didn't done the Ultra-Sound for my mother that where is the problem.
On next day, my poor mother died.

After that one of my relative was ill, they went to Ambedkar Hospital, they have given her also Glucose Bottles.
She also died.

After that My nephew ill, he went to Ambedkar Hospital, they given him 2 bottles glucose, he ran away from hospital...

They give Glucose Bottle to each patient whether any types of illness.

Doctors not talk politely, bad behavior. No suffice arrangements for patients.

Meri Mummy jeena chahti thi...
Excellent doctors, good patients management & specially best for eye patients!!
