Dear madam

My today's experience was very disappointed your receptionist ladies language was unexpected. I'm come back to home without checkup but also paid money for receipt.
Dr. renu mahindru treatment good but at the time of delivery he force for operation if possible normal delivery.

we fight for normal delivery but he force for operation and charge more money from patient
Money sucking hospital..  don't go there..
Very nice service. Careful nurses and doctors. Good timings. Vikramjeet singh and dr. Gupta are very nice.
Last year I suffered from dengue and I was treated well by Dr vikramjeet. Amazing person.
