A worse hospital, please don't get treated /admitted here even not in case of emergency.
They have labs Just to show to get registered and approval from Government. 

THE MOST SHOCKING THING ABOUT THIS HOSPITAL IS THAT THEY MANUPULATE /COOK TEST REPORT TO MAKE MONEY.

They edit reports result from OK /NORMAL to ABNORMAL.

If patient is from any panel than they MUST keep admitted 3+ days even in case it is not required. Just to make money.

Worse Pediatrician even not capable to treat a small diseases.

SOME OF REVIWERS HERE ARE THE EMPLOYEE OF THIS HOSPITAL THEREFORE ONE CAN ALSO GET FAKE REVIEW.

Good Luck !
I went there for surgery of my grandmother who is 79 years old.. I was shocked to hear such low cost of surgery... went to max hospital for the same and the cost was five times the cost told by doctor of vikas hospital.. got it operated ... and got discharge after two days.. smooth process of discharge... the bill was way less than I ever expected... and they gave us discount too... yippie...thanks vikas hospital 
Went for my backache,, someone suggested me MRI. Dr Bharat Durgia , orthopedic consultant attended me with utmost care and told ne that there is no need of mri, he prescribed me some medicines and thats it ,, i was happy doing all my regular duties in five days
Went for surgery of my buaji there, dr kochar operated on her, she is 75 year old, was operated for hernia. Excellent surgeon and wonderful staff impressed me. Being myself anaesthetist , I was quite amazed to see the quality and care they are providing in nazafgarh at meagre rates. It was a great bargain for price too. I n elated . Thank you to the team of VIKAS hospital
Best orthopaedic doc (MR BHARAT DURGIA ) in vikas hospital
