Poor reception and customer care. Bad ambiance and poor seating space. Not at all value for money.
few things needed to improve them to become best but you can ignore when you or your family gets best in class experience.
Great experience. . Attendive staff... Had a smooth experience. .. Thanl you Miracles... :-)
Pathetic Experience. Took an appointment with Dr Chetna Jain for my wife's treatment and bottom line is the hospital and doctor is completely unprofessional. They will find reasons for you to visit them time and again and pay bills. Better for health and safety try a honest hospital and avoid Dr Chetna Jain
Very convenient for lab tests. Sample pick up was done from my home at promised time. Test results were reported online by 4:30pm same day. Best lab in Gurgaon for all lab tests and consultation.
