Medical services. Needs improvement. Took 3 hrs to get medicine from the dispensary., Only 2 disp. Counter was open for male, and female. None was opened for S. citizen for around 300 patient at any time., Need to open more dispensary counter. Took 2 hrs to see doctor, he did not look like a doctor rather a junior practitioner.

People usually come here with a great feeling of Ayurveda hoping that they will be cured properly but the idiot stuff is making it worse. The OPD doctors (I don't think they are doctors, rather they are junior practitioners) are good for nothing, have zero knowledge, zero sense of humor, zero ethics. They also humiliate patients, One of the example is Pushpa Sharma. Overall, You won't get what you are expecting from this place, You will realize that in the end.", "id": 1479117183}], "longitude": 76.9334334, "address": "Khera Dabar, Delhi, 110073, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 11 6517 2030"}]
