Wonderful hospital and institute building very nice garden, very neat and clean, gives very good impression. Medical services. Needs improvement. Took 3 hrs to get medicine from the dispensary., Only 2 disp. Counter was open for male, and female. None was opened for S. citizen for around 300 patient at any time., Need to open more dispensary counter. Took 2 hrs to see doctor, he did not look like a doctor rather a junior practitioner. Had heard much and read about the hospital, but got disappointed.
One of the best Ayurvedic hospital in Delhi.
Doctor's are very good and staff is also good.
Fully ac with total hygiene and sanitation.
Fantastic place very cleans and facilities and treatment very excellent 
All staff very hard working. 
Good ayurvedic hospital with experienced doctors and fully equipped. Well managed 
Good building managed by a worst staff... People usually come here with a great feeling of Ayurveda hoping that they will be cured properly but the idiot stuff is making it worse. The OPD doctors (I don't think they are doctors, rather they are junior practitioners) are good for nothing, have zero knowledge, zero sense of humor, zero ethics. They also humiliate patients, One of the example is Pushpa Sharma. Overall, You won't get what you are expecting from this place, You will realize that in the end.
