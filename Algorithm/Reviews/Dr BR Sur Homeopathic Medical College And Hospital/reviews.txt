Popularly renowned for Homeotherapy. Situated in the heart of Delhi.
I graduated from this institution in 2006 and I feel proud of it
very good college with good facilities
worst college ... no computer lab is working there .... no sports department .... majority of tests claimed there never happen ... OT has never been in operation since last 8 years atleast .... you go with minor wounds or injuries they'll send you to some allopathic hospital ... corruption is at its peak & lol ... the list will never end :)
There are no computerized system and any lab
