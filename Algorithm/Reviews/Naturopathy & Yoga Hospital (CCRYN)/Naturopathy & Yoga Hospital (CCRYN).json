Okay if one can live with the slow pace, @times broken instruments and lax attitude. I guess reasonably priced and for places like these location near Home matters. Though they say 1.5 hrs for procedures but actual procedures are around 15-30 Minutes rest is wait time.", "id": 1484102943}, {"Review": "i like it...", "id": 1474208635}, {"Review": "", "id": 1486922875}], "longitude": 77.14256449999999, "address": "Opposite Central Jail,, Block A, Sector 19, Rohini, Delhi, 110085, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 11 6555 6777"}]
