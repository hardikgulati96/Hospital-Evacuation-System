Once for my surgery of pilonidal sinus handled by Dr. Sudhir tyagi and recently for delivery of my wife handled by Dr. Divya Agarwal. I should say both of these doctors are brilliant and takes great care of there patients. The hospital staff and administration is providing great care to the admitted patients round the clock. Everybody was very cooperative and there are systematic procedures in place for everything. The cleanliness and hygine is commendable. Overall the services and care provided by the hospital its doctors and staff is beyond the expectation and will not be heavy for your pocket. I have been in touch with Dr. Divya for a long time and I do recommend her for all pregnancy cases.", "id": 1486024084}, {"Review": "Good hospital. Reasonable fees. Kept clean.
