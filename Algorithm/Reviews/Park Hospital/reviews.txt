Great Place to be in, in my opinion these people are doing commendable job for community. it is not easy to help each one in timely manner, high possibility the have taken care of all patient walked to Park Emergency in timely manner without bothering themselves without money. People will say negative but fact remains they are too good and take care of all critical & non accepted case in other hospital Like HCV, HIV Positive. Hospital refuse to take these patient and they warmly accept them.
A good quality,neat n clean hospital for urban and panipat rural nearby area as well. Quality health services and care provided.
The doctors of park hospital are so talented that they even operated dead body of my younger brother.No humanity left only money on there mind.The patient was dead when he reached the hospital and they faked it that they are operating him. Made a bill of 1.5 lacs of a dead person.
3rd grade hospital. If you want your patient dead..do visit this hospital! Chor hain saale..they even operate kn dead people just to hoard money! Did exactly the same on recent accident patient. Save your loved ones by not visiting this pathetic hospital.
A hospital with high quality facilities. Neat n clean... staff Helpfull n Emergency case special. 24 Hours open....
