Not sure how this hospital is still working and people are rating this hospital to be the best. They are just trying to get money out of my dad's medical claim which we had done. We have no problem with that, however if they are not able to diagnose or treat the patient and recover him then what are they doing for the past 2 weeks. They are doing some tests which are out of understanding for a patient suffering for one issue they are conducting tests for some other issue. People should take their loved ones to some other hospital and never get them to this hospital. Its a pathetic hospital and they only care for the money they can extract from patients!!!!!!!!", "id": 1476120586}], "longitude": 77.1646348, "address": "West Punjabi Bagh, Pocket D, Phase 1, Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, Delhi 110026, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 11 4077 7666"}]
