First experience was bad with this hospital. also very bad behavior of doctor name was dr. verma. i was just ask some question regarding of cbc report and suddenly he was angry the behavior were deeply disturbed.
If u care about the person who is going to get admit don't go there. 3 years ago I had to admit my cousin brother. They gave expired medicine and when I contacted doctor they asked to just change it... very poor experience..
Very bad experience  with hospital  in icu dr not available.  All dr hire. Dr avilable all times.
Facilities and staff are good but they squeeze out as much money as possible 
This is a very good hospital.
