Pls don't bring your family members in these hospital ...If don't bother your family then you can bring them . They killed the people and making mo√±ey ....They simply kept dead people in ventilator for showing that he or she is alive but actually they are  making there money and the had making the fun of other good doctor's...If you don't know how to treat the patient then why you take the patient to your hospital...At last I will say that yaha madrchod paisa kmana Kaya leya bheta ha... enko koi matalb nahi ha logo sa..
Neuro hospital but the roctors make u stay for a vry long time then it is actually required.
Dear friends,

Please do not visit this hospital for any kind of Neuro problem. They give overdose to the patient. Dr. Arun sharma is the no. one fool. i do not know who has made him a doctor. he does not even know how to talk to the patient. Please visit at your own risk.
It's the only known Good Neuro Hospital in Meerut
Good quality hospitality provided and doctors are highly appreciated for their support
