Emergency- Doctors, Nursing staff & other associated staff members acted swiftly and dedicatedly. 

Ward- Once again experienced a great team of Doctors, nursing staff and Housekeeping fellows. All were very cooperative and very patient.

Took little time in discharging as Dr. advice discharge at 10am and it is 3:15pm by getting discharged. Not a major issue as of whole, the combine experience is great***

Hi, My personal experience during my mother's heart treatment it's ok for doctors but other side most of the staff unprofessional,  no proper seating for visitors,  lot of conjunction area wise, interior and equipments are not as per the current medical requirements also cghs charges is too high in terms of facilities if I campare under cghs of BLK Hospital, Fortis, Apologies,  Max and lot of other Hospitals. 
Need focus to improve professional staff and infrastructure. 
Thanks
avoid if possible patience service is worst here 
Would never leave my loved ones here again 
Good hospitality. But parking area is very restrictive
On the slip road and can be easily notice
