Hospital VERY good facility very nice , but staff member very bed behaviour ,oniy time pass
Thanks to Delhi govt. due to which hospital are free and medicines provided are also free of cost.
Only problem this hospital has, there is a long queue in every section from getting token to doctors to medical shop.
Whole day is wasted because of it
One of the worst management it has, infrastructure is quite good, doctors are helpful and frank, but the other staffs were just passing their time, patients are not treated good like other Govt hospitals and one of the bad things is that it is situated in Mangol Puri.
Condition is worst. You will get cheapest medicine of 10-15 rs. after suffering couple of hours.
Doctors are not giving any costly medicines also they're not prescribing any good medicine from outside.. kejriwal ji jiske liye apko laaye the aap to kuch nahi kar paaye.
Very good hospital. .......................nice facilities  especially ENT...department
