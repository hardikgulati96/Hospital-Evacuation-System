good hospital dr. listened and examined carefully and give good treatment to me 
i m happy and  satisfied with the nurses too.
They have a general physician that comes thrice a day for 15 mins. Very bad experience due to his wrong prescription. Caused quite bad health in a week. He prescribed the medicine of very high power unnecesarily.
This hospital staff don't  know how to take care of newborns in their nursery. Head of my baby became flat from one ear side after admitting their for only three days because of their improper care.
Some doctors are good here. Lower level staffs like dressing man or nurse are bad. I have seen a patient who came for taking of his stitches. It is a simple thing but the dressing man made him to cry and blood was flowing from his body. In ideal scenario taking out thr stitch shouldn't cause bleeding. 
I take my wife for getting injections, that also they cannot do without bleeding.
Worst hospital.... AC was leaking even in ICU room, kept patient in wet bed in the night. Lost the pyjama and specs of patient in icu, received it after multiple complaints.
