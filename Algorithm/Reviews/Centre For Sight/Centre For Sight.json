When I called again they told me that they will fix it and I will be getting a call back which I never received. Again I called them than they told me that you can simply walk in and no need to book appointment. Best part is for Dwarka center, none of number mentioned on website works.Very poor experience.", "id": 1489550049}, {"Review": "It was a good experience wisiting there.

They keep shifting you from one floor to another and getting updates from staff also takes 15 minutes... Probably everybody is too busy to hear you out. Dwarka needs a better eye clinic.
