courteous staff and supporting doctor. Thanks to Dr. A.L.Das.
Horrific experience. The reception has a board that says the ATM doesn't work and they refused to return change of 2k since they are short of the same. On asking what is the option the receptionist said 'hamara BHI nuksaan ho raha hai, customer wapis jaa rahe hai!' I am sorry as far as I last remember an hospital's prerogative is to cure patients and not call them customers or seek fayda! The docs are good, yet again the process is painstakingly slow.  The systems are down. I believe they need an it and admin updation since it's a part of a renowned hospital brand!
