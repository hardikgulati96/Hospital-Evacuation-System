I admitted her in Behl Hospital, Naraina, New Delhi immediately. The treatment given by Dr. A. Behl and his team of doctors was eye-opener to me. The recovery was very fast and now hand is in good condition. The behavior of medical and other staff was very cooperative and helpful. Everyone was concerned about the patient as they are treating their own family member. The rates were also reasonable. \n\nI saw an unexpected case at Behl Hospital. One day a very poor patient came to Behl Hospital which had injuries in leg. He requested Dr. Behl that being very poor, he could not meet expenses of the patient. Dr. Behl ordered his staff to admit his patient and assured him for best treatment without any cost. I was surprised to see this type of behavior in this era of evils.", "id": 1469170924}, {"Review": "I am staying in noida with my friend since a year or so for my studies.

We went to well known hospital. They did ultrasound. According to them ultrasound was normal. But condition of the child started deteriorating. Then we went to Behl Hospital for second opinion. Then doctor on duty told that symptoms are indicating towards intestinal rupture. Dr. behl send us in ambulance for urgent new ultrasound from City X Ray Diagnostic Centre. It was diagnosed that intestine was ruptured. A team of doctor did surgery during late night and now life of the child is safe. We are very thankful to Dr. Behl and his team.
