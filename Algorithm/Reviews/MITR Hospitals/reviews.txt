Operation is too successful to compair others hospital all OT staff r very well educated.thank u mitr hospital.
Inexperience people... They are just doing research here on the wellness and  money of patient.  Though few good people are also here. First time I have seen 5 people came to take blood sample and either of them don't exactly knows what to do.  Forget about security.
Incompetent staff and doctors. They do not know how to handle the most basic cases. I'm attaching picture of how they administered an injection and overcharged me. The advice that doctor gave me was that digene and meftalspas should be taken in case of hiatal hernia.
Called to book an appointment for general physician. The attendants were impolite and unprofessional and disconnected the call 5 times when i tried calling repeatedly. They deserve 0 star. I could hear people giggling away aa they shamelessly said they could not hear what i was saying.
