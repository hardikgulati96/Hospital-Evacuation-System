Worst hospital in sonipat city.Chor hospital.
V. Bad. 

Its try to get extra money with unlimited test and experiment .first they play with patient without taking advice to specific doctor  they try to Identified his disceased when dc cannot identified than thay advice to refer anyother good hospital between this they try to empty your pocket as much possible. Bad service in ward. Care and room . Also useless rules to meet icu patient. Not a  good management to handle a multi spl. Hospital.
 I was not satisfied after taking 5 days treatment there.
Thief's... Worst...... Confused ......No service
Doctorâ€‹ walks 80 steps and charge 1000 ruppees without touching patient...Specially Dr Prashant
Gud 24hr services.. Dedicated staff n all faculty under one roof 
Good staff good doctor, i am staff nursh student,i am join tulip hospital .
Had an endoscopic surgery for Pilonidal Sinus for my son at Tulip Hospital. Dr. Akhil Saxena did an absolutely wonderful job. He is a pioneer in Video-Assisted Endoscopic Surgery in North India. For an otherwise open surgery that would have taken weeks to heal, he did it using A Videoscope which had my son back at home, hale and healed in flat 2 days. 
Even the better and big hospitals in Delhi don't have this latest technology in surgery. Would highly recommend this hospital and Dr. Saxena for any need for Surgeries.
