Dr. Akhil Saxena did an absolutely wonderful job. He is a pioneer in Video-Assisted Endoscopic Surgery in North India. For an otherwise open surgery that would have taken weeks to heal, he did it using A Videoscope which had my son back at home, hale and healed in flat 2 days. \nEven the better and big hospitals in Delhi don't have this latest technology in surgery. Would highly recommend this hospital and Dr. Saxena for any need for Surgeries.", "id": 1479047675}], "longitude": 77.03422909999999, "address": "112 \u2013 113, T P Scheme, Near Civil Hospital, Delhi road, Sector 14, Sonipat, Haryana 131001, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 130 223 2211"}]
