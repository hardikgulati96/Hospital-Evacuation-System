My best time in india. When I go outside from this hospital I was clean and have my feel never so good in the last 10 years.
Hello Doctors and Hello Sisters ;-)
Good hospital 
Good private hospital
Good hospital with excellent facilities.
They have hired goons in gaurds uniform who abuse at people on the road and dr. kalyan sachdev is completely silent about the same...... maybe he has given them the authority to do so,

think before you enter this place and the services the would offer and how they would treat you !!!!
