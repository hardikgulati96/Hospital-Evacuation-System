I visited Venkateshwar Hospital some 2 months back and I am really happy with their caring and convenient services. Especially the medical staff here is really good they keep proper care of every need of the patient. Also the location is very good you can visit here from any corner of Delhi. I recommend Venkateshwar to everyone looking for a good hospital.
Neat and clean place, with inhouse most amenities.

Doctors are less as little less patients.
Good people good infrastructure good staff there is everything so good about this hospital. I strongly recommend everyone to prefer Venkateshwar Hospital over other because of the services and caring support staff here. I havenâ€™t seen a hospital with an infrastructure as brilliant as theirs. Great work guys J
Dr.P K Sharma is the best doctor working....he is having the aura of a perfect doctor and he aims to treat the patients as his priority not as just another "PATIENT"...!
My experience with Venkateshwar Hospital was very good. Very impressed by the infrastructure of the hospital. The lifts are fully functional there is 24 X 7 power supply good patient care, I really appreciate the services of the hospital and the care of the support staff. Good keep it up.
