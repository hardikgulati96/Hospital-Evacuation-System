Good,fast and professional service. Keep it up like this.
Good, clean with efficient doctors.Though they are slightly commercial (which hospital isn't). Had a gall bladder operation once(which I could have done without) and had to fight over the final bill. But overall good doctors.
Doctors are never on time, prescription says 5 pm , if you call they will tell u 6pm and doctor will come whenever he feels like , waiting for 1 hr and nobody knows where he is 7pm now
Good hospital and ECSH facility
One of the best hospital in Greater Noida.
