Security staff except ICU are very rude n uncultured n untrained. Nursing staff (barring few) are no better than govt hospitals. If you ask Value for money, I will say NO. It's a no smoking zone but hospital staff, including the senior ones do smoke inside the premise, right under the no smoking sign.
One of the best hospital in India for heart surgery, very well experienced doctors, world class management and infrastructure. Clean atmosphere, good ambience 
If 0 star is possible option I will give that to this hospital. Medanta - dedicated to life they must change it to Medanta - Dedicated to MONEY, this perfectly goes with what they actually do.
The hospital is very good.All kinds of medical facilities are available 24/7.The doctors are very helpful and caring.They also care about patients life rather than caring about the money.
A premium location if you can afford. 
A JCI accredited hospital raising the standards every day
Right food to the right patient mission
Food and Beverage Services as per Health and safety standards
Beautifully designed and located in the heart of Gurgaon.
