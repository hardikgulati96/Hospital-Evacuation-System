World class facilities with the best doctors from all over India. The Hospital has a research oriented college too under Sharda University.
Really good and friendly hospital staff and with nearly all facilities.
Doctors of sharda hospital are very much efficient.. I would suggest Dr. Vikas bharadwaj his consultation as a neurosurgeon is quite good. Good supervision this hospital provides..
Good facility this hospital provides.. Dr.sudhir consultation as an orthopaedic is quite good.. Investigations like MRI provided by this hospital is beyond expectations in greater noida..
I am very grateful to you and your team for thr excellent support by you all during My treatment...  Dr.  Manish sharma (cardiology ) his consultation is very appropriate..
