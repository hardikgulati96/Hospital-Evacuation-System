Extraordinary and very quick discharge process service provided by Mr.AJAY today for our patient mrn 18014, meenu's assistance from billing desk was also appreciable. Ajay's behaviour is always very warm and affectionate in all our visits and admissions in this hospital. Hope he keeps it up. All the best.
I have visited the hospital for the first time to meet gynae doctor, but with busy schedule there was no slot available for consultation, but one of the staff from reception Mr Ajay, spoke to doctor & requested her for my wife's consultation, although with booked time doctor agree to consult. I am very thankful to Dr Vinita & Ajay for their support, all healthcare facility should have these kind of doctors & supporting staff.
