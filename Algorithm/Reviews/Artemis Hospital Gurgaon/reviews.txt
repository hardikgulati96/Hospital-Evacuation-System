Doctors are very professional..
But the management is very poor.. 
Your appointment time has no meaning.. No need to be punctual at all or don't go by their reminder messages... 
No parking space.. Parking is a big issue in the hospital.. They need do to make sure they have adequate parking space for the expected people..
Alot of improvement and organizational setup is required...
Also not adequate space in the cafeteria to sit and eat...
They act very professional but some more improvement is required...
Doctors are very good but the nursing staff and upkeep of infrastructure is worst. Nurses have made the ward area a fish market they keep on talking whole night but no one is there to tell them that patients need silence and peace of mind to text to recuperate fast! In so called suite the phone doesn't work no pillows and bed sheet for attendents and no basic amenities for the money the hospital is charging. Frankly it's the doctor who have still survived through their best treatments otherwise the total infrastructure is very very poor! I had written same to CEO but he also seems sleeping so far!
Best hospital in Gurgaon...
Doctors and staff are very nice..
My doctor Renu Raina shegal is one the best doctor..She is very positive and caring..
Trying to contact on landline number ??????
Please dont waste your valuable time and money .
they never picking-up the calls. Tried many times 20-25 minutes holding, listening music but no answer .

What a Healthacre Service !!!

ZERO STAR
Good hospital and infrastructure. There is a lot of scope for improvement in services though, especially the in patients should be treated better. Can't just leave the in patients to the whims and fancies of lower staff and forget about them.
