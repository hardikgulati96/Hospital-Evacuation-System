I loved it. Had a surgery here and was very scared of it. But the doctors placed all my fears to rest. They are very empathetic and professional. I recovered fast and well. 

The whole team do their best to make you feel like home. Which is the best part of all.

Thanks a lot FIMS.
Frank Institute Of Medical Sciences (FIMS) is being run by Frank Life care Pvt. Ltd.
Fims is a better place for quality hospitality & treatment of ailments through a large penal of specialized medicine experts & surgeons.
Its a big achievement for city.
Thanks to its founder Doctors.
To cater best , specialized treatment in various streams,is the goodness of FIMS hospital at Bahalgarh road , Sonipat.
Though it is little bit expensive of all local hospitals but much cheaper than Delhi's good hospitals. Specialist s n staff are so much caring enough to increase life expectancy.
Incompetent and arrogant staff. Management Money looters. They really don't even know basic cannula and Catheter procedure.
Used to go to Delhi for dialysis every week.
But FIMS, offering quality super specialty services, has helped us a lot in saving time,money, and hassle.
The cost is almost 1/3rd than most of Delhi hospitals for treatment by same doctor.

Undoubtedly, the best.
Highly recommended.
