Good hospital .and also at good location, Easily approachable Good environment.
building is old and they don't work onÂ  Cleanliness part of the hospital staff. but Quality of service has improved but still there is a scope of improvement.
5 Stars for doctors, 0 for the staff behaviour, over the time staff behaviour has changed, special thanks to Dr. Rajeev Agarwal.
Nice hospital with almost all kind of facilities. 

Too crowded, long wait , cleanliness and hygiene are suspect. Post operative care is also suspect.
