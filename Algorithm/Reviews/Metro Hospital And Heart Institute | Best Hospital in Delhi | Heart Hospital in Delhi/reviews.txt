One of the cleanest HDU (High Dependency Unit) with a very dedicated staff, right from nurses to the doctors. Accommodating with minimal fuss about simplistic needs. My dad was admitted for cardiac issues, and a couple of doctors came to help - Dr Noor, Dr. Kanwar and Gaurav Mahajan. Awaiting our discharge n successful return to home. Their are a few improvement areas such as limited waiting room area for attendants who stay overnight (ICU patient's attendants), parking space and canteen offerings. Still it works as they focus on core offerings.
Worst Hospital and faculty ..  doctor are damn  worst and staff too , Patient apke pass thik hone jata hai na hi apke Fund badhane , i am planning to  do action against hospital some one please suggest  me how can i do ?
It is OK But doctors are trying to make more money. 
Medical Shop @campus active 24*7 !!
Worst doctor in the whole hospital is deepak talwar of pulmonary branch...i dont know about the others...
Junior doctors doest even care about anything they just prescribe medicine...
And the worst thing is that when the patients are waiting the so called SENIOR DOCTOR will give time to Medical representatives ...
Been treated for more than 5 years here but no benefits...
Basically they dont cure the disease they just contain it...
