Though large signboards claim free medicines being offered, but reality is only one or two medicines out of all those prescribed by the doctors are issued free of cost here. Rest are required to be purchased from the Alka Farmacy.
Worst place to work as junior resident, talk very well while joining (before MCI inspection) but treat very badly after it. The whole hospital is under control of chairman  and hr . The dean and ms have no authority. They never pay your full salaries in time , cut any amount from salaries. Terminate anyone without giving any reason/ any misconduct. Not advised to my colleagues to join this college .Had a very bad experience here.
World college of Medical Sc & HOSPITAL has great infrastucture and latest medical machine for medical testing
Excellent and experienced faculty for budding MBBS students
One of few medical colleges to get letter of permission in a short span of its  
establishment........with great effort by  chairman and his team.
