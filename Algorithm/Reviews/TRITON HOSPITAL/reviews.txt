Thank you team TRITON for being ever so patient with us, answering our unending queries and helping us remain at ease. It was a pleasure to be treated at a place that for once doesn't smell like a hospital as I have Hospital phobia. Your ever smiling staff and their commitment towards  patients  is highly appreciated. I also would like to place on record a special thanks to the team of doctors, who made a critical medical procedure seem like a cake walk. Wish you a great success!
Amazing facility with state-of-art equipment, where one feels one is getting the best care. They have an extremely helpful and upbeat staff, very knowledgeable physicians who believe in keeping patients informed and include them in decision-making. A very clean hospital, beautiful ambience, tastefully decorated and furnished, unlike the rest of them seen mushrooming all around. My whole hearted support and good wishes to them!
