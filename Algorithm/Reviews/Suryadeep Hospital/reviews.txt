Support staff is worse. I guess I met Irfan in emergency who hardly knows how to speak. Shocked with his rude behavior. Will avoid going again.
Best doctor and nurse and other staff of the town. Nurse and doctor all very caring and great hospital ever go. For it.
I gone twice over there to get my diseases fixed but there were no good results.

Paying 600 bucks evrytime for nothing to too much.

I will never go there again.

Giving 1 star also is also making it overrated.
Suryadeep Hospital is a family hospital . Facilities are too good, effiecient staff, best Doctors of the town are working here.Dr Sanjeev Gupta is a gem of a person difficult to be found in today's society. Patients get best care  here. I give best wishes to Suryadeep Hospital to keep it up its qualities.
very nice hospital , doctors reception staff , nurses all very caring  true value for money . will recommend to everyone , had been to big corporate hospitals also , but  personal touch i receive here was matchless
