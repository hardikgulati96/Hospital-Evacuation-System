GNH Hospital has very good ambience, competent and friendly doctors, staff at GHN will never make you feel away from home", "id": 1490183913}, {"Review": "My friend injured his knee (minor) during sports and we rushed him to neelkanth hospital (Near Guru Dronacharye metro station) because he was in pain, Neelkanth charged Rs1800 and done nothing apart from pain killer injection. Next day we consulted GNH hospital Dr. Yash (Ortho), From here is why GNH is 5 star for me.\n1) Hygiene :- Clean and even bed sheet are covered with white paper which will be removed after every consulting.\n2) Professional :- Doctors were well dressed and will discuss the problem.\n3) BEST PART: they won't charge you anything just to make profit. They are surely not like Gabbar movie. Doctor Yash said that he has called for physio therapist but if it is not physio case we have to go for MRI. And Physcio (A girl I don't remember the name) seems less experienced but worked professionally in 10min cured my friend by analyzing the fact that his patella got locked and need to be placed again on right position. Rather than getting profit out of patient (by unnecessary MRI) they do what is only necessary.\n5. Even Doctor first concern was to look for some nearby hospital to take 2-3 sittings of physio sessions, shows are are concerned about patient and not money. \n4. They gave ultrasound, EVC (or something similar), Ice pack to my friend. Keeping my wallet ready to pay some heavy amount they charged only Rs500 :O.\n\nFor such hygienic and quality treatment (Ortho) I highly recommend them at least Dr. Yash and Physio there (2 girls both look inexperienced but are really talented). \n\nPS: I have only consulted ORTHO and will surely recommend them.", "id": 1478193461}, {"Review": "This is the one step solution under one roof.This is the best hospital with the best doctors", "id": 1489648105}], "longitude": 77.04309889999999, "address": "GNH Tower, Near Sector-14, MG Road, Opp. Govt Girls College, Anamika Enclave, Gurgaon, Gurugram, Haryana 122001, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 124 482 7000"}]
