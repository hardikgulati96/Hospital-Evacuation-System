Highly unprofessional and careless
i had been to Emergency at 12.05 A.M. tonight and was treated for  stomach upset and sent back home around 1.30 A.M.
When not recovered and visited again to Emergency at 4.20 A.M., everyone there was sleeping. When asked to call Doctor, one attendant named Rajeev (name as informed by him) told us that Doctor is busy and can not come out for discussion but rather advised us to go to Saroj Hospital.
When we asked Rajeev for the name of the Dr.., he went back to Dr. room to ask his name and told us his name as Dr. Anuj.
Only after approaching to the person at reception and after his phone to Emergency, Dr. Anuj bothered to come out of his room n informed us that he has already given the best treatment and now he can not help us anymore but to advice to go to Saroj Hospital as they can call a consultant or else we should get admitted.
This is the height of Carelessness and a strong action should be taken,
