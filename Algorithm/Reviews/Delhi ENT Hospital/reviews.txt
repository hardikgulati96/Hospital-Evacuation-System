It was a very bad experience. I had gone coz of dizziness and had asked for Dr. kacker at reception, he just replied back 500 rs for consultation. Later when i went for consultation, understood am being consulted by another doc, Dr. Abhishek.
No proper diagnosis, I told him symptoms, and when I told him it might be Vertigo, he wrote tabs and told nurse to handover a pamplet of exercises.. less than 2 mins, didnt even tell why it happened or any precautions etc... Later when i consulted another doc, I was even more surprised coz of how well he explained and treated me.. wasted Rs500/-.
and will suggest not to visit this place expecting good treatment.
Not answering calls at all.  No one seems reaponding to queries.
Very good hospital for ENT treatment. 
Amazing ENT hospital right inside Jasola Delhiüëç
Very good hospital equipped with modern technologies. Nice to see respected Dr. Deepti Kamal there, an amazing  and humorous eye surgeon of high quality.
