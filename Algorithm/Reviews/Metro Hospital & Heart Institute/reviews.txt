Good place. The doctors here are very knowleadgable and experienced. Services that are provided here are also okaish.
Pathetic hospital..if you tell them that you have medical insurance, they will start doing unnecessary tests to make a good amount of bill. Also, the nursing staff, reception and TPA dept is working as a govt job. They will do your work only when you will stand on their head.
Pathetic doctors...only there to mint money...no responsibility towards patients. If they come to you have medical cover, even for fever they advise you to get admitted. Worst hospital overall.
I want to give 0 star but option is not available. 
Worst  private hospital i have ever seen...

Dr. Sumit Wadhwa was visited in OPD.
His behaviour was very good with his patients, but the arrangement of lower staff for giving entry to doctor's room was not satisfactory. 
Needs some improvements.
