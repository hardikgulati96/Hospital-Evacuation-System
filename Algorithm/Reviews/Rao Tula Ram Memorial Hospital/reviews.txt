Good hospital in rural area.Every medicine available here which prescribed by doctors.
Very dirty not well maintained . Doctors are also not friendly. Doctors also come late.
Nursing staff of the hospital is so irresponsible and rude. Doctors team  must more strict to to their duty and if they don't do as so they should liable to complaint the Head of their team.
