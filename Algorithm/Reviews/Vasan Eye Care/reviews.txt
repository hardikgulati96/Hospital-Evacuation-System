Good care of eye but beware with it pocket
Dnt go there at all. They dont even tell you the status of your problem. Even they prescribe the same eye drop to every one which is available on their medical store.
Vasan eye care  Good for eye checkup.
Very poor services...even the treatment is not reliable, my mother eye is damaged. They make money only (charged 50K) and waste our time also ..don't go vasan eye care specially preet vihar ...I gave (0 out of 5)
Worst doctor on earth. Mrs Hema, so called doctor here, dose not know how to talk the patients. I have visited there along my parents and she was talking too rude with everyone. they have given me report with no name of patients on the page. 
completely "choro ka adda" only time and money wasted with poor doctor.
