One of the best hospitals till date. The prices are very reasonable considering it is a private hospital. The doctors here do take their time to listen to you and come to a valid diagnosis. Money is going to be spent in healthcare and I truly enjoy the returns the money gives here. I would like to mention the Oncology Department for their stellar work in treating so many patients.
Since the day I have started visiting this hospital, my experience every time is worse than before. No coordination amongst the staff, no contact person, no proper information, full of careless attitude...
I would not recommend the hospital to any one. There only priority is patients from foreign nationals. I would have never visited this hospital, if my doctor would not have been part of the hospital. Pathetic management.
Third class service and treatment is very costly .At the time of admision bill was very small but at the of discharge bill amount just double . patient will suffer definitely heart attack. Pls don't come here .
Thank you.. Thank you.. Thank you.. I cannot express my gratitude towards you with few words Dr. RAJESH SHARMA... for best pediatric cardiac surgery and a challenging person for complex heart surgery with good result. Thank you so much doctor.
Good if you are insured with company or policy. Money machine needed for a small treatment. Good services
