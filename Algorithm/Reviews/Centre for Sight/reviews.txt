Best hospital for eye check up. I was able to get my eyes checked within 45 minutes without appointment. Very efficient and got good diagnosis. I don't wear specs anymore. Very good doctors.
Highly unprofessional people...wrst administration. Had an encounter with Mahesh and Preeti at sector-29, Gurgaon. Very very bad experience.
Good hospital and very humble staff. 
Speciality clinic for eyes and related disorders,professional doctors and caretakers... RECOMMENDED..
Good doctors who will trwat you well and not misguide you.
