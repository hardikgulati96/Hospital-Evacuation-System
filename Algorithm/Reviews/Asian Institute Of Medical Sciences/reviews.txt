My friend had a major heart attack last weekend  and had triple bypass surgery.  He spent spent 5 days in the ICU and is now recovering in the cardiac unit.  The staff were wonderful and his treatment was first-class.   The staff took the time to explain everything to us and were kind and empathetic.  Can't rate the hospital and staff highly enough.
Always had a highly satisfactory experience at AIMS. Dr Rishi Gupta has always attended each of his patients with great care, extremely supportive. Very well behaved staff  . I am very happy with their excellent behavior. God Bless them.
Worst Experience. Guys please read this review very carefully if you want to save your family member(Don't come in this Hospital). Dr. Manav Manchanda (Respiratory Department) Killed my grandmother on 7th Feb'17. He don't have manners How to talk with people ( Uneducated person) He shifted my grandmother from I.C.U (When she was on Ventilator) to a general ward ( the ward according to him was mini I.C.U where all equipment's and machines were too old. My Family members requested him several times to shift her in the  Main I.C.U where she was before but he denied & said " Tum to C.G.H.S(Kind of Mediclaim) Ka Fyada utha rahe ho" and when he shifted her to mini I.C.U Cum General ward just after two days my grand mother died because of his Carelessness &  effortless job. Duty of Doctor is to save patients life but he was not doing so even not showing his best efforts. God is watching everything Dr. Manav Manchanda .
