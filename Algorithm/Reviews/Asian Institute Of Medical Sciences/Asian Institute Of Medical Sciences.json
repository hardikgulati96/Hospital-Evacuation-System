Dr. Manav Manchanda (Respiratory Department) Killed my grandmother on 7th Feb'17. He don't have manners How to talk with people ( Uneducated person) He shifted my grandmother from I.C.U (When she was on Ventilator) to a general ward ( the ward according to him was mini I.C.U where all equipment's and machines were too old. My Family members requested him several times to shift her in the  Main I.C.U where she was before but he denied & said \" Tum to C.G.H.S(Kind of Mediclaim) Ka Fyada utha rahe ho\" and when he shifted her to mini I.C.U Cum General ward just after two days my grand mother died because of his Carelessness &  effortless job. Duty of Doctor is to save patients life but he was not doing so even not showing his best efforts. God is watching everything Dr. Manav Manchanda .", "id": 1489906251}, {"Review": "Really, very nice experience with asian hospital. All staff are really cooperative.
