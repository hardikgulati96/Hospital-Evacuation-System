Once visited. Hope, god would not make me to visit again. Hospitals not good to visit. Cleanliness well maintained. Well mannered staff. Facilities are good.
Old name that has emerged into arrogance and pathetic service. Big buildings housed by poor doctors.
Super Speciality Hospital
It's just a small clinic. You can only meet the doctor. I suggest you must go to Medanta - The Medicity.
Awesome service
