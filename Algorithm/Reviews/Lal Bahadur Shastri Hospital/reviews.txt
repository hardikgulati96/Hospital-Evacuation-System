Doctor's and other staff doing their best to give healthcare to huge crowds. Good quality doctors. Infrastructure is a limitation.  
IS THERE ANY DOCTOR FROM BENGAL OR BENGALI DOCTOR..... SPECIALLY gynaecologist AS MY WIFE IS UNKNOWN ABOUT ANY OTHER LANGUAGE OTHER THAN BENGALI
This is Delhi govt hospital,There is no C- arm in main operation theater, so what the precision and accuracy for any surgery, so be careful for any trauma procedure. What about media and govt that  no worry for public health just making fool.
Hospital with good facilities at very cheap prices, but queues start at 6 am in the morning, so it takes lot of time..atleast 4 hours.
Very rude behavior by the staff nurses. They need to do something about it.
