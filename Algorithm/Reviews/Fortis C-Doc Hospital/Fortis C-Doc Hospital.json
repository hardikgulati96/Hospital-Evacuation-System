In first visit they charged 1400 for consultancy, I met a doctor, he told me nothing about how to cure diabetic foot, just told me how to control sugar and also recommended another doctor. Today I met Dr. ashok (diabetic foot specialist) again I paid Rs, 1200 to meet the doctor, again he did nothing, just told me what I have I already known (asked me about medicines nd precautions I have been taking) then repeat the same thing. As many other's told me about this hospital was true, they don't care of their patients and just think of how to make money. Telling me, about the charges of hospital, dressing, operation, room (I'll take aftr the operation), just speaking about the MONEY.", "id": 1475932807}, {"Review": "Dr. B B Dash is very good doctor and nursing staff is very helpful. That's why I am giving three stars. But if you are planning to get admitted here than carry your food and linen,  the kitchen and kitchen service is dreadful. Food quality is below average and kitchen staff attitude is like government hospital. The linen they have in hospital is very old and dirty.", "id": 1464315105}, {"Review": "Visited this hosp when it was newly opened. It is a super expensive hospital. Dr. Anoop Mishra prescribed numerous tests for me costing around Rs.20,000 unnecessarily. I went for a minor thyroid problem and he asked me for all non sense tests. The clinic was newly opened so obviously they wanted to take full advantage from innocent patients. Finally went to another doctor who was surpised why I was told to get all these tests done.\nDont go to this money minting clinic !! \nWill never recommend the doctor and this hospital. \nAvoid at all costs.", "id": 1470463806}], "longitude": 77.24943950000001, "address": "Fortis C-Doc Hospital, B-16, Opp Devika Tower,, Chirag Enclave, Nehru Place Flyover, Chirag Enclave, Greater Kailash, New Delhi, Delhi 110048, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 11 4910 1222"}]
