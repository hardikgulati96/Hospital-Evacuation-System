My grandmother was on dialysis since 3 months & had a fall & suffered from incomplete fracture of hip at home & trauma to her right side. I want to thank the entire tram at Manas for a successful Hip replacement and also for the continuous support by the Dialysis staff to keep her hail and hearty. She is doing good :) thanks to God and their representatives on earth .
