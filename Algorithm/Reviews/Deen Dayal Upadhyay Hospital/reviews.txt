Worst hospital I have ever seen.
If the patient is in serious condition then don't even think about going here.
Ek report k liye idhar se udhar ghumate rahenge and in the end they will say patient ko le kr aao.
I mean are u kidding me
The patient is in serious condition and you are saying to bring the patient for a report.
All other government hospitals are far better than ddu hospital.
Can be visited in case of emergency at any time. Its open 24*7. Parking is at owners risk. Separate rooms are allocated according to the concerned treatment. Major facilities are available. Medical stores are available just outside the main entrance of the hospital. The hospital has 2 entrance. One from the front and other from the back side.
They provide best hospitality service for their patient üëå üëç
Best for poor people but it take too much time
