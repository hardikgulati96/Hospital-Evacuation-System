Just awesome....well maintained..
All international equipments.... congratulations Mr. Anil Gupta and Thanks.
Wrost hospital ever seen. there is 4th class cafateria with poorest facilities. it is very coarse and dirty.
Have you ever seen commom toilet for ladies and gents in any public place.?
Therer is in QRG on ground floor Staff toilet in wich both males and females goes. All the system is frustrated.
Worst experience.. I suggest to my known people never come here. Doctor's are not puntual. My 5month son was cries alott for 1hour then his doctor came.. anesthesia doctor was very irresponsible.. overall my experience was very very bad. People here for only making money.
Good but not expected how much they charge
A very very clean hospital and very good all staf
