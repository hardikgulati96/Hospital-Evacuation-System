Good Hospital...
Improved in many ways..
Mahabir Dal Hospital is considered to be the most reasonable Hospital in Karnal as it is a charitable Hospital.

Doctors are well qualified and Medical aid is available 24/7. There's also a medial shop at first floor of the main building which remains open 24/7.
Use to b a good hospital but now they only Care for money
Goood work by this hospital in public domain as the treatment fee is Affoardable & good facilities...
This is a charity hospital...

BUT BUT still some doctors here are not good and charging a huge fee compared to other private hospitals. 
And also they r making money medical stores etc. etc...

Anyhow, Baby Delivery Deptt. is so good and affordable yet..
Can not say for the future years as the Arpana was good some years ago.... But now.... Ha  haaa haa
Though the hospital is being run by a charitable trust but corruption is on rise. Better to visit a private hospital or even government hospital
