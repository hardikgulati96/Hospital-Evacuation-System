Visiting best doctors , most of the ENT doctors available, but hardly to find there timings. For say it is open 24 HRS but reality is no one can open the door before 9:00 a.m. 
Very old hospital near national highway (NH-58) and modi colony.
Not so good hospital. Doctors are difficult to find, even hospital staff works as doctor and the main thing is schedule timing is not proper to opening the hospital.
