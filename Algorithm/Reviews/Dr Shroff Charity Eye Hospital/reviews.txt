Excellent staff and doctor at ENT department. Free parking available for patients.
The worst hospital ever visited.Staff members are totally irresponsible and behave really very bad with the patients.No care for their essential time. Staff is only money minded after getting payment they don't care anything about the patient.I will never visit this hospital again and also suggest readers not to waste their time and money by visiting here
Dr. Shroff eye Centre Kailash Colony is very bad in services and behavior of receptionist staff. They doesn't respect to patients and their time. They misguide the patient from appointment time. Please don't go to this Centre. But Gurgaon branch is really good.

Dear Sir rating and experience is very poor  there is a lot to work on services.
1. attendant behaviour very poor
2. way of speaking very poor
3. No one is ready to listen 
after paying 51500/- cash amount for surgery there was no wheal chair for patient
4.There was no one to give update about what is happening with patient
5. even no one cleaned patient face there was blood on her face.
6.Asking photocopy of case file for which already paid 51500/- hospital want ID proof of patient
7. Its clear harassment.

I give very poor rating. 
one of the best facilites for patients can be found in this treatment 
with such large area cover it uses each&every corner judiciously nd preciously The Seperate Children Department is one of the best facilites around the Delhi-NCR and enables
This Hospital  Focuses mainly that needy ones should be treated first nd free of cost 
Finally I would like to say a word of thanks to Dr. Suma Ganesh Mam and Dr.Prem for their service which enhanced my vision from 6/36 to 6/18 
Thanks A Lot SCEH for your kind service ....
With Love From
Sudhanshu Yadav
