Amazing experience, one of the best doctors u have in the hospital. I had to go there for my mother's treatment. They were very helpful, emergency doctor Nivedita Bali worked amazingly and helped my mom recover by the morning. I would really recommend this hospital to my friends and relatives. Kudos
Do not contact this hospital for Emergency. 
At least in emergency the doctors are absolutely useless, and not compassionate at all. I live 5 min away and called for an ambulance at 1230 in the night for my grandfather who suffered a cardiac arrest and informed them of the situation. The ambulance came after 30 min. All my follow-up calls were answered rudely, with an " all we can tell you is that the ambulance has left from here".
The doctors who came with it took leisurely strolled from the society gate to my house ( I saw them through the window). My grandfather passed away because he did not get medical attention in time.
FYI- The name of the doctor who attended was Dr. Nivedita Bali
It was a sheer waste of money. After a long wait when the doctor finally arrived.. he was done with the check up in less than 2 mins.. prescribed antibiotics and insisted on purchasing the same from the hospital pharmacy. Also what I found funny was the doctor was reluctant to tell me when and how to take the medicines, until I have purchased them from the hospital pharmacy!
Worst hospital, terrible services and worst management. No doctors available. Simple waste of time, money and expectations for better services.
Such a nice hospital.. my daughter was having a surgery of tonsillitis problem.. and they started with full concentration.. they discharged her within 4 hours.. surely go for minor or major injuries there.. facilities are very very good.. excellent job keep it up
