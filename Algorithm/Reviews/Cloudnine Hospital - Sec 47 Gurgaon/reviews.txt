We had an amazing experience. The staffs and nurses were very supportive. They made our 4days stay at the hospital quite easy and smooth. The food was good and of reasonable price. It's a good maternity hospital.
Money making racketeers... no service they are worst then Government hospitals 
I consulted Cloudnine Gurgaon when my wife and I were not able to have a baby even after trying for nearly three years. One of our close friends then suggested us to consult a fertility expert, who introduced IVF to us. The doctor first detailed us about the procedure together with its pros and cons. After understanding and pondering over every aspect, we decided to undergo the treatment. The service at Cloudnine was outstanding and its result is seen in form of our angle that came into the world about a month ago. Besides fertility, I even liked the pregnancy and maternity service at Cloudnine in Gurgaon, and I pray for their success.
