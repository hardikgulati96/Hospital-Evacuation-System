One of our close friends then suggested us to consult a fertility expert, who introduced IVF to us. The doctor first detailed us about the procedure together with its pros and cons. After understanding and pondering over every aspect, we decided to undergo the treatment. The service at Cloudnine was outstanding and its result is seen in form of our angle that came into the world about a month ago. Besides fertility, I even liked the pregnancy and maternity service at Cloudnine in Gurgaon, and I pray for their success.", "id": 1464862678}], "longitude": 77.057441, "address": "Plot No. A-2, MSJ House, Mayfield Garden, Sector 47, Opposite Hilton Garden Inn, Beside SS Plaza, Block A, Sector 47, Gurugram, Haryana 122003, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 1860 500 9999"}]
