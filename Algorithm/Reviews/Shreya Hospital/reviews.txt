Staff is very kind . But facilities need to be improved a lot . Its excellent for small things and to get first aid but if any major thing its not worth it
I m very proud of shrey hospital my father is beack thanx god and shriyA hospital doctors
Costly medical shop, the medical shop keeper in the hospital offers everything at mep, even if the guy is earning more than 36 percent margin specially the surgical items where 10 - 20 percent ks Ã¨
The hospital is average. Needs more effort & improvement to be better in providing hassle free services to the people. Although doctors are co-operative.
Very bad and worst hospital ... specially doctors behave like fool n unprofessional and they also getting support of management better don't go for treatment.
