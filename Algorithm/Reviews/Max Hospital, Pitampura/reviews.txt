If you love your life please don't go there doctors there are trained to loot you. They can try the medicine on trials on you. They gave me the wrong treatment tried trial medicine of migraine on me. I was never went there for migraine.  
Very bad hospital. I delivered my baby there and they made my case worst....I had very bad experience with the doctor Shipra Gupta gynecologist, she is very unprofessional n frighten us for my baby.
Good hospital. Kinda sad that its being torn apart for some fire escape issue. 
Worst Experience!! "SCARE PATIENT,EARN MONEY" Dr GYAN GOYAL forced me to come tomorrow  to his clinic only then he will tell whats my eye power is. He was doing same thing with every patient. I paid 500Rs to MAX Hosp.  then he was asking 300rs at his clinic. 800Rs for simple EYE CHECKUP.  :(
 paise chaiye to bheekh he maang lo...hosp ke bahar beth jaao.. katora hum de denge.. Never Ever Go there..
Gone there for EYE CHECKUP, got to know about a fraud, the doctor Mr. Gyan Goyal. (His clinic at shalimar bagh on the back side of everbake).

He basically sits in max hospital to get all the customers of max hospital to his clinic, he shares his card with them to get max's patients. 

they are charged 500 at max hospital and then the doctor requests to come to his clinic only then he will give proper consultancy. so  for a 300 rs consultancy you have to pay 500+300, 500 goes to max and 300 to doctor. Whats the use of it. its a fraud.

If I am going to max I know max hospital all the treatment and consultancy should be strictly done in max, if Tomorrow I go to hospital A, A want me to go to B, B wants me to go to C, C wants me to go to D. during my way I keep on paying 500 rs to each of a,b,c,d who would be bigger fool than me. I would request you to please spend your money carefully if it is earned by honest means. Thanks
