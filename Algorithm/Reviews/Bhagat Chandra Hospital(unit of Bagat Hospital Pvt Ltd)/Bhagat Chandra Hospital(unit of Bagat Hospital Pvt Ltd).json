Staff is less and burdened. They have high pressure of management. No resident doctor to attend, they visit sporadically or On call. Nursing staff not polite, they behaves as if they are doctors. Neither listen to you carefully not attend you on time.\nThey charges almost equal to any good hospital in Delhi. So, my suggestion to find hospital elsewhere for maternity.", "id": 1474261664}, {"Review": "Good hospital near Dwarka flyover.
