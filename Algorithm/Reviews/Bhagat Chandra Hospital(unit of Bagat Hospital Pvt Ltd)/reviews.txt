White dresse main daku h. hospital chor h dad body check karne ke 60000 le liye bach sako to bach jao koi mat jao
For Gynae & Maternity, We did not feel good experience. Staff is less and burdened. They have high pressure of management. No resident doctor to attend, they visit sporadically or On call. Nursing staff not polite, they behaves as if they are doctors. Neither listen to you carefully not attend you on time.
They charges almost equal to any good hospital in Delhi. So, my suggestion to find hospital elsewhere for maternity.
Good hospital near Dwarka flyover. But they don't have surgon on Sunday
Overpriced and not good hospitality. They don't care your sickness they focus on fillings their pocket. Doctors are not good either.
If you love your self or your nearest one, plz don't visit here...
