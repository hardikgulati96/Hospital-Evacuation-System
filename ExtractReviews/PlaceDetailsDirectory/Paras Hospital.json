We went to this hospital at 11 PM for a friend down with chuknguniya. For us it was cashless and my friend was entitled for a separate room with an extra bed for attendant. Somehow They managed to give a bed in the general ward.They can't even provide proper bed to the patient and the attendant has to sit outside whole night. The general ward was more like a fish market and I bet no one can sleep properly. They made us to go through various tests. The doc was supposed to come next morning.We kept following up for the doc but doc came and left at 2 PM and we had no clue about when he came and left. Best part was he forgot to see the patient. They kept on providing glucose sline. When we asked doc has not yet come.They called the doc and doc said he will come at 6 PM. As we are still sitting here we are planning to shift to another hospital.
