No matter how good the hospital looks the intention is to squeeze you as much as the last drop of money is taken out.\n\nI attended the hospital and was asked to do several tests including blood, MRI, CT and X-ray.  It was frustrating when the doctors did not glance at the results except the X-ray. This would mean to me that all the rest of the tests were unnecessary but I paid 53000R to do them and stayed an extra day for the results to be produced. Besides the money they take I don't know about the risks involved when one goes into all those machines,\n\nAfter visiting the doctor, I was scared to death for not attending to the hospital on time and was advised to do a surgery. The estimate given to me for the operation was between 7 to 11 hundred thousand...I sought a second opinion from a few doctors outside india. I was releaved to hear that the problem was common and that I should not rush for the surgery. I was recommended to meet another hospital here in Delhi that was more specialised on the subject. I went to the hospital and after they looked at the X-ray, and measurement a different degree to the illness was given. They recommended a chest brace. I paid 6500R for brace. To respect the process I went back to Max to say that I was not ready for the operation. Max recommended that in that case I needed a brace to the neck and that a chest brace will not work...a brace to the neck will cost me 20000R and I have to wait and pay the hotel bills for 5 extra days.\n\nWho to trust and who to believe in Delhi specially health care ,when ethics is missing, remains a mystery all together. \n\nGone are the days that strong humanly hearts existed in simply built walls.
