best care is given here in terms of treatment, stay, medication. Very supportive staff and good patient and doctor relationship. The only one thing i would like to suggest ..pls make a room for patient attendants where we can sleep at night. Rest i am very satisfied with it.
Metro hospital has improved a lot...it is well managed and neat and clean hospital. My experience here with doctors and employees have been very nice. We are going to metro hospital for our all health checkups or general consultation from last 10 years...so have that trust in it..God bless

I visited metro hospital for my sister maternity case..All hospital told us for pretty mature delivery but when we came here and consulted Dr. Seems Bansal ..She told us that baby will be on time....n she was right...My sister gave a birth to a healthy baby . We are thankful to her and metro hospital Faridabad for their best treatment.
