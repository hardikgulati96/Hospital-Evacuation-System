Managment is worst ... government hospital is better than this place....all are confused and ruling on their individual territory...
No comfort for patients...
I am here to receive a report Nd whole department is running without any clue...
Please avoid this hospital- My mother was treated here(thyroid operation) was discharge and become unwell on the first night after reaching home. Then again was admitted in the Icu (same metro hospital - preet Vihar)  for several days. As per the ICU doctors then she had cardiac atteck.She passed away on 4th of Jan 2017) in the ICU/CCU. I am in process to find out more as at the minute we are totally shattered. ... I am writing to request everyone to please avoid this hospital as I have a feeling that they don't have full resources to run this hopital including doctors and nurses!!!! Whole hospital is under renovation - very filthy ....
Doctors are unprofessional seem as they are unqualified or marketing executive they don't have professional doctors. Doctors come their on call from other hospital .I went their for my mother treatment they took her in ICU for 15 days and but they didn't diagnosed my mother as per the problem finally after discharge my mother was still critical then I took her to Max.
The faculty is not good. System of this hospital is not good.Behaviour of nourshing staff in not good .
ITS MY FIRST VISIT IN THIS HOSPITAL, BEFORE COMING TO HOSPITAL I HAVE CALLED TO ASK ABOUT THE TIMING OF ENT DOCTOR THEY SAID ITS 9 - 9:30 IN OPD, BUT NOW ITS BEEN MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR I AM WAITING FOR THE DOCTOR TO COME & WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE DOCTOR AGAIN THEY SAID DOCTOR WILL TAKE ANOTHER 30-45 MINUTES TO REACH HOSPITAL .

REST WILL SEE, THAT HOW'S A DOCTOR ???
