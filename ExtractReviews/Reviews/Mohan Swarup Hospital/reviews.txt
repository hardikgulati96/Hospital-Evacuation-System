Treatment, atmosphere is good. Main problem is with medical store. They charge every thing on MRP which costs to patients very high. Generally we get medicines from outside at 5-10% discount rates. This is only store here so people are forced to purchase from here only.
Infact doctors write those medicines which are available only with this store. This is my personal experience.
Providing good treatment at a very affordable prices. Staff is also good
It's a trusty hospital, provide best treatment in reasonable rates. 
Best services provided with very experienced team of Doctors.
Best treatment at good price
