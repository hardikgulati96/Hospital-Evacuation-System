They prescribed me wrong no for both eyes. my existing no is less they prescribed me 0.5 higher than existing. When i made specs of rs 5000 with prescribed number i am not able to see clearly thus new specs wastage for me because my eyes are 6/6 with my old one. i dont know why they carelessly examined. bad experience
Excellent cetre
Good doctor
Provides a commendable service, staff is knowing what they are doing and is very friendly. When I went to Dr. Vineeta she sat me down and explained how the test is going to go down I received a thorough examination and the tests were explained to me very carefully. I will recommend Dr.Vineeta to all my friends.
I've been visiting Drishti eye care for couple of years and it has been a great experience for me.  I've met both Dr. Vineeta & Dr. Arora and i've found them very helpful if not entertaining, LoL. They have a huge variety of frame selection and they can make any frame for your glasses.
