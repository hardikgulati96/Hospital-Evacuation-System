Economical than others. Paramedical staff is not good. 
Convenience of a 24 functioning hospital with all basic health services at zero cost in neighbourhood
its okay if you have cash crunch but better and clean then most of govt hospital
Good Hospital with good facility...but crowded also

Staff is very rude..
