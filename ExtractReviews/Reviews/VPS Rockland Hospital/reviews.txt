I will have to go with the review of the Orthopedic surgeons. The write up on the site is good, but only the third ortho who is based in the dwarka branch checked my father and gave some sensible advise. The Physiotherapist on the other hand was quite professional and helpful.
Absolutely pathetic service. Simple X-ray was to be taken but even after two x-rays, they need one more. Moreover, the Doctor (Ortho), who attended the patient was the most illiterate Doctor I have ever met in my life. He does not know what communication is, especially when it comes addressing those who accompany the patient. "Call the security and kick these guys out" is all he could say... all this because he examined the patient after the X-ray was done. And he calls himself an Ortho Surgeon... 

More so, he has the guts to call the security to kick us out. Such doctors should be kicked out of the hospital immediately. 

Strongly recommend not to visit this insane place. There are just a bunch of jokers sitting here trying to manage the show.
