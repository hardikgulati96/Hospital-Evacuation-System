Excellent services by W Pratiksha Hospita! One of my friends had a neurological problem and he visited the Neurology & spine departments few months back. He is now doing well. I highly recommend this hospital. One of the top notch hospitals in India, W Pratiksha delivers its best every-time. We were extremely pleased with the service! Excellent doctors, staff, technology & infrastructure!
Very pampered services to babies and mother . Infrascture is awesome. Doctors use latest technology. Overall experience was fantastic but It was too much expensive ..(Ahh...I couldn't afford).
Honest staff. I had forgotten my credit card on the OPD billing counter. I called the front desk to ask them to try to locate the card. I returned back and luckily they had found it and returned it back to me. Great staff, cooperative & a really neat, clean and happy hospital.
My overall experience far exceeed expectations! Friendly staff and highly professional surgeon, doctor was very helpful as well. The interiors are modern, very well maintained, clean and conducive!
I visited to W Pratiksh Hospital for treatment of my ear drum hole. Since the first day of visit, i was well treated by Dr Geetalima Dutta. She has suggest for all the prerequisite required for my treatment. For the every followup she has treated very well. And at last day came for my surgery. All things went in very smooth manner. From the first day, i was admitted in hospital, every second i got good hospitality from hospital side,regular doctor visit, well house keeping. I was very satisfied with the hospital management end to end. 
All the very best..!!!
