Good hospital and educational institute for BDS ,for poor people it's a boon young minds used to treat people in minimal cost.
Bad experience, it is cheap but better than the government hospitals, medical students practise.
It is inside the subharti campus, having a wide parking, near to highway58 and so many atms are present inside the campus.
Great Hospital with great team of doctors I recommend to everyone to visit it when required
Good only doctors  works
