This is the worst hospital we have encountered. Please be aware when you get treated at this place. If doctor prescribe the medicine nurse ask you to get the medicine but they don't give to patients & later sell those to make money.  This place blood bank also charge you 3.5k for 1 unit instead of 1k actual cost & say if you want take it otherwise go. This institute is just mony making place. If you don't monitor the reports & medicine given, the nurses skip things & always try to manipulate the data & they don't even mention the actual results to patients. Be very careful when you spent money in this hospital.
