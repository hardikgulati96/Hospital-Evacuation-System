Please be aware when you get treated at this place. If doctor prescribe the medicine nurse ask you to get the medicine but they don't give to patients & later sell those to make money.  This place blood bank also charge you 3.5k for 1 unit instead of 1k actual cost & say if you want take it otherwise go. This institute is just mony making place. If you don't monitor the reports & medicine given, the nurses skip things & always try to manipulate the data & they don't even mention the actual results to patients. Be very careful when you spent money in this hospital.", "id": 1459997580}, {"Review": "not good hospital at all , unprofessional doctors with very unprofessional staff and . doctor and nurses are not supportive at all.\nnot recommended.
