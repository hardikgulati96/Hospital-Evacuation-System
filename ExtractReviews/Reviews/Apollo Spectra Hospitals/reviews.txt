Thankful to all doctors, nurses and helping staffs of this hospital for the great service they gave during my Hernia operations.
Excellent job One of the best hospitals  in Delhi though it is expensive also. Staff is very polite and well trained. Some doctors are really good.
Poor management, since there was no one at the reception. Waited for like 20 mins No one came, I was suffering from high fever and felt really vexeted when the receptionist came and said that only RMOs are available and there was not even a proper physician available.
It was good experience with Apollo spectra.. 
Poor reception  they are all liers they say wait 5 minutes for doctor , their 5 minute will be 2 hours, Since 3 days I want to meet doctor Punit Dilawari but still im unsuccessful  to meet  him , And the behavior  of reception  is very but after they get the consultation  fees. But some doctors are good in there like Dr Mohanty. 
Good management
