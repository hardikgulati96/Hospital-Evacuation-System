Nurses have made the ward area a fish market they keep on talking whole night but no one is there to tell them that patients need silence and peace of mind to text to recuperate fast! In so called suite the phone doesn't work no pillows and bed sheet for attendents and no basic amenities for the money the hospital is charging. Frankly it's the doctor who have still survived through their best treatments otherwise the total infrastructure is very very poor! I had written same to CEO but he also seems sleeping so far!", "id": 1483723007}, {"Review": "Best hospital in Gurgaon...\nDoctors and staff are very nice..\nMy doctor Renu Raina shegal is one the best doctor..She is very positive and caring..", "id": 1488546577}, {"Review": "Trying to contact on landline number ??????\nPlease dont waste your valuable time and money .\nthey never picking-up the calls.
