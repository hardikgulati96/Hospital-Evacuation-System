I had gone coz of dizziness and had asked for Dr. kacker at reception, he just replied back 500 rs for consultation. Later when i went for consultation, understood am being consulted by another doc, Dr. Abhishek.\nNo proper diagnosis, I told him symptoms, and when I told him it might be Vertigo, he wrote tabs and told nurse to handover a pamplet of exercises.. less than 2 mins, didnt even tell why it happened or any precautions etc... Later when i consulted another doc, I was even more surprised coz of how well he explained and treated me.. wasted Rs500/-.\nand will suggest not to visit this place expecting good treatment.", "id": 1489735525}, {"Review": "Not answering calls at all.
