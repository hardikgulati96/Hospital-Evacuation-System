Outrageous charges for anything and everything and hardly any service. Hospital claiming to be 5star have one very slow lift in whole hospital which takes ages to move. Rooms not properly equipped. Nicu nurses very rude and possess no understanding of what patients are going through. Next time, if needed, I would prefer to go to smaller nursing home rather this big brand. To others - try to do research of potential expenses prior and monitor everything to avoid any nasty surprises.

> 21st century and still no hearing test in the hospital in year 2014 
    Who suffered? My baby. In need of Cochlear Implant now
> whose gain- Doctors
   A paediatrician,Dr. Raghuram R, who didn't check responsibly and totally disinterested about our observation regarding my baby's hearing. 
> if we invest so much of our money in a hospital for proper care/treatment of mother and child, what is your duty towards us, esp the baby?
Amazing experience during my pregnancy, prenatal yoga and delivery , Dr. Neena Bahl is very good and the staff of la femme is very co-operative especially nurses.
Pathetic experience.  They don't even know how to test a blood group. The reports had a wrong blood group, Wrong test results for one of the infection. One of the doctors was extremely rude and misleading. I don't recommend it to anyone.
Very Good experience for my pregnancy follow up and delivery. Dr Anjila was the best
