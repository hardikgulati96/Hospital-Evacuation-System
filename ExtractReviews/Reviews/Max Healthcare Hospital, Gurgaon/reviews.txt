May be its smallest in size among all big names in gurgaon but indeed this hospital is doing really great. Maintaining good patient to staff ratio. Never over burdened with work hence assuring quality quite well.
Excellent care provided by Max GGN team.I suggest to all this facility for excellent Consultants and Nursing care. I felt homely like environment while in hospital and the hospitality is owsome...Thank you all those attended me.
Horrible experience in emergency- visited emergency when my wife fell done and got a cut in her head. though she was not bleeding but her head was paining. The emergency doctors saw and went off. I had to wait for 30 mins. When I called the docs, they told either to wait or go to some other hospital. So I had to go Fortis emergency. I had my wife treated and I had to pay only Rs.500. These emergency docs in Max are juniors who will put canula and give injections and would make a huge bill. Once I had paid Rs 4000 for fever and cough. Request to the hospital authorities to be human.
Visited and availed medical services multiple times. Very satisfied.
Overpriced,overhyped hospital. Pathetic doctors only here to make money
