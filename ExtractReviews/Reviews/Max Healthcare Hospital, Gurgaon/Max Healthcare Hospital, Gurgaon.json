The emergency doctors saw and went off. I had to wait for 30 mins. When I called the docs, they told either to wait or go to some other hospital. So I had to go Fortis emergency. I had my wife treated and I had to pay only Rs.500. These emergency docs in Max are juniors who will put canula and give injections and would make a huge bill. Once I had paid Rs 4000 for fever and cough. Request to the hospital authorities to be human.", "id": 1476940043}, {"Review": "Visited and availed medical services multiple times.
