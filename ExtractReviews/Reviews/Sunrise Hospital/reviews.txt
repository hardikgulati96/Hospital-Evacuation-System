Hospital is Professionally. But
In ICU also they don't have cleanness and staff do gossips & chatting.
There is only one doctor Amit Thakur  who is responsible for everything  anyway he has good knowledge no doubt. But SeRvice is low
Very good treatment and facilities. I have been under treatment of Dr. Shuchi Gupta, Homeopathy for Skin Rashes. The results of the medicine seem quite effective.
Hospital infrastructure is not good and staff is also not good professionally.

There is only one doctor Sanjeev Thakral who is responsible for everything  anyway he has good knowledge no doubt.
I am noy sure who has given these more than 4 stars reviews. Might be management or hoapital staffs who were instructed by their seniors. I had to visit this hoapital for 2 cases in my knowns. Everytime I was stunned to see this hospital as fraud business hub. They always charge their patients high wrongly. They force you to buy medicines from their medical shop and then charge 3 times more from outside market. 
One of my friend opted for IVF treatment here. Estimate was given around 1 lakh. Treatment is still in process and their billing counter has been crossed 3 lakhs. This is rubbish. 

So this is business center rather than a hospital.
Best Healthcare services at affordable cost. Keep it up.
