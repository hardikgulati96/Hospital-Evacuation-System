Might be management or hoapital staffs who were instructed by their seniors. I had to visit this hoapital for 2 cases in my knowns. Everytime I was stunned to see this hospital as fraud business hub. They always charge their patients high wrongly. They force you to buy medicines from their medical shop and then charge 3 times more from outside market. \nOne of my friend opted for IVF treatment here. Estimate was given around 1 lakh. Treatment is still in process and their billing counter has been crossed 3 lakhs. This is rubbish. \n\nSo this is business center rather than a hospital.", "id": 1475402882}, {"Review": "Best Healthcare services at affordable cost.
