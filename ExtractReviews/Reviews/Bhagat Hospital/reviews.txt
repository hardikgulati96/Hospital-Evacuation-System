All they care about how much money they can suck out of you. From receptionist to doctor just don't care about you. Medicine they sell from their own dispensary can be found outside with around 70 to 80% lower rate because they write of some specific drug companies(whichever give them most profit). Will never visit again.
"Good service and patients care."
Bhai sahi mayne main loot ka adda hai, doctor are only prescribed medicine those only buy from opp. site medical store (only one have those medicine). in very high price. but same composition medicine are available in other medical store in very low price
a good private hospital near janakpuri or sagarpur
This hospital is just for money making hospital, they just don't care about the patient. Dr. Neha Bhargwa is not good for treatment, she is very rude with patients actually they only wants the money anyhow. I think govt. Hospitals are much batter than bhagat hospital. So please guys its request to you so not with that. They are making you fool.
