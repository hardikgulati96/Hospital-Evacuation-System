I am really happy after losing my glasses  at Centre for Sight and definitely you get  what exactly you want for your spectacles removal surgery from a hospital/doctor.  and staffs.  Keep up the good work Centre for Sight for making patients feel good & special.

Very stupid customer care experience, I booked appointment Dwarka for next day for morning hours and next day they changed appointment to afternoon without even asking me. When I called again they told me that they will fix it and I will be getting a call back which I never received. Again I called them than they told me that you can simply walk in and no need to book appointment. Best part is for Dwarka center, none of number mentioned on website works.Very poor experience.
It was a good experience wisiting there. Everyone was very helpful and co-operative. The doctors were very good and explained well. Upto the satisfaction.
counsellor behaviour is not good, please Aafdargung or Vikaspuri. All doctors are good.
The wait time is too high... For an emergency consultation also you need to take an hour. They keep shifting you from one floor to another and getting updates from staff also takes 15 minutes... Probably everybody is too busy to hear you out. Dwarka needs a better eye clinic. Disappointed!!
