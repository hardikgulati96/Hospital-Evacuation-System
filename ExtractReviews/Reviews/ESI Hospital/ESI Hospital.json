Staffs are knowledgeable but don't want to work. One can't find satisfactory results. Here also there is problem for food. Canteen is not well maintained although there is a facility of CCTV camera but the quality of food is just like if it is for patients only. One can find the food outside also but that is not hygienic. In rainy season there is a problem of water logging in the place. One can find the renovation work only pre to some audit work. Else God bless the hospital and patients.", "id": 1486290116}, {"Review": "Much better than Maulana Azad dental hospital..lesser Waiting time , no extra fees charged from the patient, world class treatment for the patient.\n", "id": 1484970165}, {"Review": "worst working system,no one listen properly ,everyone ignore ,nover understand what is the actual problem of patient .", "id": 1469264835}, {"Review": "Finest dental hospital......much better than maulana azad...", "id": 1458485938}, {"Review": "Very helpful for me\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a", "id": 1479445404}], "longitude": 77.12590999999999, "address": "Opp HP Petrol Pump, Sector 15A, Rohini, Sector 15, Sector 15A, Rohini, New Delhi, Delhi 110085, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 11 2786 1033"}]
