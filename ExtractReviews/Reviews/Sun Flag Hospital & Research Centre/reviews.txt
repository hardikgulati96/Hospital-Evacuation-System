Such a bad & worst experience with Dermatologist Prof. Dr.TR Bedi.
Such a arrogant and rude Doctor.
If you don't have your medical history with u then Dr.Bedi will not attend you and he will throw papers on you.

Interesting factor :-
Suna tha Doctor bhagwaan hota hai,
Par jinse hospital chalta hai ya jinke liye Dr.ko appoint kiya jaata hai,unko SRS Sunflag me aise treat kiya jaata hai....

Lagta hai Govt.ne take over kar liya hai Sunflag hospital ko.


Total ethical and scientific services in all the specialities.  Team of experts in respective fields. Reasonable charges. 
Nice staff
There is nothing to like.

Charges are exorbitant and service is extremely poor.
Doctors are experienced but the paramedical staff is simply below mark.
As such there is a lot to be improved.
There are a number of hospitals in Faridabad, otherwise.
Good hospital with a good healthy atmosphere
