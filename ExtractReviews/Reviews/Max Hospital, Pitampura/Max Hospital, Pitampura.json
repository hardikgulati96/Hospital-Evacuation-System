I paid 500Rs to MAX Hosp.  then he was asking 300rs at his clinic. 800Rs for simple EYE CHECKUP.  :(\n paise chaiye to bheekh he maang lo...hosp ke bahar beth jaao.. katora hum de denge..

(His clinic at shalimar bagh on the back side of everbake).\n\nHe basically sits in max hospital to get all the customers of max hospital to his clinic, he shares his card with them to get max's patients. \n\nthey are charged 500 at max hospital and then the doctor requests to come to his clinic only then he will give proper consultancy. so  for a 300 rs consultancy you have to pay 500+300, 500 goes to max and 300 to doctor. Whats the use of it. its a fraud.\n\nIf I am going to max I know max hospital all the treatment and consultancy should be strictly done in max, if Tomorrow I go to hospital A, A want me to go to B, B wants me to go to C, C wants me to go to D. during my way I keep on paying 500 rs to each of a,b,c,d who would be bigger fool than me. I would request you to please spend your money carefully if it is earned by honest means.
