It's a good hospital having emergency ward too. A bit costlier than other options. Very good surgeons are there
It's very good Hospital. There are many great Doctors in the Hospital.
Personally I have had good experience with Dharamsila Cancer Hospital, NOIDA. They provided good services which really helped to get permanently cured from cancer, although chemotherapy negatively impacted sight of one eye.
Though would not want anyone to be coming to this one. But this is my first rating for a hospital and I find this one a very welcoming and clean hospital minus the negativity which generally surrounds a hospital. Well maintained 
In 2014, my relative had to be rushed to Dharamshila Hospital when he was having a prostate cancer. At that time, I was extremely impressed with the emergency department's response time and quality of care. 

 The First important thing which I liked is the pleasing attitude of their Nursing Staff towards patients/attendants. 

I must appreciate the Dietary Services also who were always on time with hygienic and tempting food for the attendants.

The Doctors / Nurses and the services of this hospital, all are appreciable.
