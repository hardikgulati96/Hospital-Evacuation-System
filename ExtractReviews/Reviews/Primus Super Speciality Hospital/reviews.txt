Best team of Doc for joint replacement under the guidance of Dr. Surya Bhan ( Best in world) 

Thank u so much sir.. my grandfather is now walking freely without pain and all credit goes to you.üôè

Clean environment internally as well as externally 

May god bless you all. I must not fail to particularly commend Mr. Anurag Sharma of the internal desk for his wonderful public relations, very patient, carried our job to the best of his ability above all representing the hospital in line with international best practices.
Helpful doctors... polite helping staff... well mannered and helpful attendents.. overall my experience has been pretty good..
Clean and hygienic hospital with highly proficient medical faculty. Takes a lot of time to get through the front desk. Doctors often prescribe medicines that are available only in the in-house drugstore. Overall expensive. Don't go here if you don't need surgery.
Service is poor. But the lab is awful. I have been told by doctors many times already not to do my tests in Primus lab. To get your report you have to come at a given time then you will be asked to come in two hours then tomorrow and only when you go downstairs to the lab they will tell you that sample is lost. At least this is the truth. Sometimes after Primus tests (with normal results) people did the same tests in different labs and were getting absolutely different results. Food for thought...
