It's impossible to reach them by phone for booking and when you do, turns out it doesn't really matter. Whatever time of appointment they give on phone, your number is in process again when you reach clinic. Also, doctors are always in rush to move on.", "id": 1481281777}, {"Review": "If you have the whole morning up to at least 2pm then make an appointment! Doctors never come on time, the staff seems like they are doing everyone a favor and in the last 2 months I have received the same response \"Dr.Darius Shroff is on leave for 15 days\"! Seriously? \n\nI am not saying that doctors cannot take leave, but when you are 'collecting' patients, how about having back up doctors who can look after the patients without having to spend the entire day at the Centre. A little more responsibility from doctors and care and empathy from the staff could make this place more tolerable. \n\nI AM SWITCHING TO ANOTHER CENTRE simply because of the long holidays and the slovenly treatment from the staff.", "id": 1466400638}, {"Review": "Very dedicated and very sensitive to the needs of senior citizens ", "id": 1490242668}], "longitude": 77.0780319, "address": "110, Bestech Chambers, Radisson Suites, 1st Floor, B Block, Sushant Lok Phase I, Near HUDA City Center, Sector 27, Block B, Sector 43, Gurugram, Haryana 122009, India", "international_phone_number": "+91 124 470 9999"}]
