However, this does not make up for incompetent patient care.\nThere is complete lack of communication between the operational staff, assistants and the senior doctors. Most of the time the assistants have no clue on what their senior doctor is doing or has advised his patients. Its left to Patient's attendants to hurry around, get hassled and figure out themselves what is happening or the line of treatment for their patient...... and this is very very scary. \nIt seems the doctors are only concerned of getting patients admitted and generate money for this very big nursing clinic.\nIf you are getting admitted here please be very very aware on how the doctor is going to treat you", "id": 1480829138}, {"Review": "Worst hospital ever.

Never go in this hospital atleast in emergency.", "id": 1488892433}, {"Review": "Shri Balaji hospital has cunning doctors and worst staff. They keep their patients till they can extract money from them. My yncle was admitted there for cancer diagnosis these ppl had charged us around 4 lac rupee that too can't save my uncle. However his condition got so deteriorated after treatment that he can't even remember his own name. After putting him so many days in icu they said we can't save him, deposit the money n take him home\nWe some how manage the money n paid them fees. With in few days he died.\nThere so many other good hospital which are reliable n provide good service at same amount just go somewhere else", "id": 1487984607}, {"Review": "Good place I had a adenoids surgery there thanks to dr KS Nagpal", "id": 1489584494}, {"Review": "Good hospital with 2 wings.
